### Reference

This exercise attempts to reproduce the graphic predicting the outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election found [here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo).

The edition of the graphic to be reproduced is timestamped as "UPDATED JUL. 11, 2024, AT 1:53 PM".

Here is a non-interactive presentation published on the website associated with the timestamp:

Key features associated with this graphic (in no particular order):

+ The larger the margin in the electoral college, the more intense the red (Republican) or blue (Democrats).
+ The labels on the x-axis are not uniformly distributed.
+ The electoral college ties are presented as distinct and apart from the non-tied results.
+ Hover over any simulated outcome, and the declared winner, with electoral college spread, will be displayed.
+ The columns group electoral college totals in counts of five (5).  For example, the simulations where the winner won anywhere from 270-274 will be presented in a single column; the same with 275-279, 280-284, 285-289, and so on.

## Graph Construction

### Data Collection

The source data for this graph could not be found, so I used both DataThief and WebPlotDigitizer to extract the data from the graph.
